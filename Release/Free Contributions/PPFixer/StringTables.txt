You can edit the included "script.rc" to include your plugin's command string tables.

Then in PureBasic under Compiler\Compiler Options\Resources add the script to your project.

The string tables are now built into you plugin. No need for resource hacker.

Also, Include is a litte program written in PureBasic (source included) that will 
automatically fix the constructor and destructor of your plugin removing the need for a hex editor.
