PurePLUGIN Upgrade informations :
---------------------------------

As a remind, when a DarkBASIC Profesionnal "Licensed plugin" is supported by PurePLUGIN, you must be sure to have it work correctly, that:
1. You own a copy of the supported plugin that is activated (otherwise PurePLUGIN will not be able to use it)
2. The person that will use your plugin that is 'plugin dependant' will have to own an activated copy of the used plugin too (otherwise, your plugin will not work on hise computer)
3. Don't forget that if the plugin you call need a command to initialize it, you will have to put the initialisation command in the DarkBASIC Professional source code (or within your dll but with the adding of a command from the plugin to force compiler to include it.)

PurePLUGIN 1.5 Upgrade:
-----------------------
- Updated to handle eXtends 1.3 and eXtends 1.4
- Added support for DarkSIDE plugin pack.
- All includes for commands file are now in an external file to reduce main plugin DLL .pb file size.
- If PurePLUGIN is not installed when using your plugin, error message will now request to download pureplugin from Odyssey-Creators website.
- Added support for DarkBASIC Professional U6.7 functions: ?D3DDeviceLost@@YAXXZ and ?D3DDeviceNotReset@@YAXXZ
- Upgraded Griffirrs 's PPFixer tool to handle PurePLUGIN 1.5 changes.
- Updated PurePLUGIN Samples to use 1.5 changes including U6.7 and Dependencies system.


Explanation about eXtends dynamic handlers emulation :
------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this special feature for PurePLUGIN, is to allow developer to create plugin that are 100% compatible with eXtends.
What is the interest ?
In fact, when you create a large amount of objects, you'll notice that if you try to do a simple function that check for the first free media, it can take times to find it.
So, what the emulation will make ?
In fact, I've modified all eXtends referencies used for Dynamic media creation/deletion/cloning, etc ...
What the result ?
the result is quite simple.
If you use a command like :
BitmapID.l = BMP_DynamicMake( Width.l, Height.l )
PurePLUGIN will do this:
1. If eXtends plugin is detected, it will use its dynamic bitmap creation system.
2. If eXtends plugin is NOT detected, it will use a simple FindNextFreeBitmap() function and use the first free bitmap to create it using default DarkBASIC Professional commands.
the interest is quite simple. if you have a large amount of medias, eXtends is faster than the FindNextFreeBitmap() function. and, it makes system compatible with games created using eXtends plugin.
So, if your plugin's users use eXtends, your PurePLUGIN plugin, will be 100% compatible with no changes to do for you, nor for the user.
In all cases, your plugin will allocated medias dynamically.
