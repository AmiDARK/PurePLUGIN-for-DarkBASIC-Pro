PurePLUGIN 1.3 - DarkBASIC Professional eXtra functions :
---------------------------------------------------------

This directory is available from PurePLUGIN Ver 1.3 and newer.
It contain extra functions/procedures that are not defined in the main PurePLUGIN.DLL because these functions/procedures are too specific.

How does it work ?
If you want to use an eXtra functions file, you'll simply have to include it this way in your main DLL project file:
[CODE]
  IncludeFile "..\DBPro_Extras\DBProExtraFunctions1.pb"
[/CODE]

This include can be placed everywhere before this line:
[CODE]
ProcedureCDLL AConstructor00YAXXZ()
[/CODE]

After this, you'll have to include the function SETUP_ExtraFunctions1() inside your Constructor procedure (at the end of it, just before the EndProcedure)

If will then give you access to all functions/procedures available in the file, from your DLL project.

PurePLUGIN 1.3 - Extras 1.0 :

- Added functions/procedures to handle bitmap manipulation with GetBitmapData(...)
